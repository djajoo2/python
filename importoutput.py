NAME
    math

DESCRIPTION
    This module is always available.  It provides access to the
    mathematical functions defined by the C standard.

FUNCTIONS
    acos(x, /)
        Return the arc cosine (measured in radians) of x.
    
    acosh(x, /)
        Return the inverse hyperbolic cosine of x.
    
    asin(x, /)
        Return the arc sine (measured in radians) of x.
    
    asinh(x, /)
        Return the inverse hyperbolic sine of x.
    
    atan(x, /)
        Return the arc tangent (measured in radians) of x.
    
    atan2(y, x, /)
        Return the arc tangent (measured in radians) of y/x.
        
        Unlike atan(y/x), the signs of both x and y are considered.
    
    atanh(x, /)
        Return the inverse hyperbolic tangent of x.
    
    ceil(x, /)
        Return the ceiling of x as an Integral.
        
        This is the smallest integer >= x.
    
    copysign(x, y, /)
        Return a float with the magnitude (absolute value) of x but the sign of y.
        
        On platforms that support signed zeros, copysign(1.0, -0.0)
        returns -1.0.
    
    cos(x, /)
        Return the cosine of x (measured in radians).
    
    cosh(x, /)
        Return the hyperbolic cosine of x.
    
    degrees(x, /)
        Convert angle x from radians to degrees.
    
    erf(x, /)
        Error function at x.
    
    erfc(x, /)
        Complementary error function at x.
    
    exp(x, /)
        Return e raised to the power of x.
    
    expm1(x, /)
        Return exp(x)-1.
        
        This function avoids the loss of precision involved in the direct evaluation of exp(x)-1 for small x.
    
    fabs(x, /)
        Return the absolute value of the float x.
    
    factorial(x, /)
        Find x!.
        
        Raise a ValueError if x is negative or non-integral.
    
    floor(x, /)
        Return the floor of x as an Integral.
        
        This is the largest integer <= x.
    
    fmod(x, y, /)
        Return fmod(x, y), according to platform C.
        
        x % y may differ.
    
    frexp(x, /)
        Return the mantissa and exponent of x, as pair (m, e).
        
        m is a float and e is an int, such that x = m * 2.**e.
        If x is 0, m and e are both 0.  Else 0.5 <= abs(m) < 1.0.
    
    fsum(seq, /)
        Return an accurate floating point sum of values in the iterable seq.
        
        Assumes IEEE-754 floating point arithmetic.
    
    gamma(x, /)
        Gamma function at x.
    
    gcd(x, y, /)
        greatest common divisor of x and y
    
    hypot(x, y, /)
        Return the Euclidean distance, sqrt(x*x + y*y).
    
    isclose(a, b, *, rel_tol=1e-09, abs_tol=0.0)
        Determine whether two floating point numbers are close in value.
        
          rel_tol
            maximum difference for being considered "close", relative to the
            magnitude of the input values
          abs_tol
            maximum difference for being considered "close", regardless of the
            magnitude of the input values
        
        Return True if a is close in value to b, and False otherwise.
        
        For the values to be considered close, the difference between them
        must be smaller than at least one of the tolerances.
        
        -inf, inf and NaN behave similarly to the IEEE 754 Standard.  That
        is, NaN is not close to anything, even itself.  inf and -inf are
        only close to themselves.
    
    isfinite(x, /)
        Return True if x is neither an infinity nor a NaN, and False otherwise.
    
    isinf(x, /)
        Return True if x is a positive or negative infinity, and False otherwise.
    
    isnan(x, /)
        Return True if x is a NaN (not a number), and False otherwise.
    
    ldexp(x, i, /)
        Return x * (2**i).
        
        This is essentially the inverse of frexp().
    
    lgamma(x, /)
        Natural logarithm of absolute value of Gamma function at x.
    
    log(...)
        log(x, [base=math.e])
        Return the logarithm of x to the given base.
        
        If the base not specified, returns the natural logarithm (base e) of x.
    
    log10(x, /)
        Return the base 10 logarithm of x.
    
    log1p(x, /)
        Return the natural logarithm of 1+x (base e).
        
        The result is computed in a way which is accurate for x near zero.
    
    log2(x, /)
        Return the base 2 logarithm of x.
    
    modf(x, /)
        Return the fractional and integer parts of x.
        
        Both results carry the sign of x and are floats.
    
    pow(x, y, /)
        Return x**y (x to the power of y).
    
    radians(x, /)
        Convert angle x from degrees to radians.
    
    remainder(x, y, /)
        Difference between x and the closest integer multiple of y.
        
        Return x - n*y where n*y is the closest integer multiple of y.
        In the case where x is exactly halfway between two multiples of
        y, the nearest even value of n is used. The result is always exact.
    
    sin(x, /)
        Return the sine of x (measured in radians).
    
    sinh(x, /)
        Return the hyperbolic sine of x.
    
    sqrt(x, /)
        Return the square root of x.
    
    tan(x, /)
        Return the tangent of x (measured in radians).
    
    tanh(x, /)
        Return the hyperbolic tangent of x.
    
    trunc(x, /)
        Truncates the Real x to the nearest Integral toward 0.
        
        Uses the __trunc__ magic method.
